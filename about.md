- Chris started his career in server operations supporting a large infrastructure including thousands of servers (mostly physical ones back then) and quickly evolved into learning to code. These skills allowed him to support a large environment without a large army of sysadmins.

- He coded the process to collect immense amounts of data including: WMI, event logs, disk space, anti-virus versions, etc. He then created executive dashboards giving a holistic view of the environment. 

- Chris then immersed himself in software development, making web applications for unemployment services, financial applications surrounding the mortgage process, enrollment and quoting engines for health insurance.

- He started leading development teams and began organization changes to use agile practices. This enabled his teams to quickly add small and large features allowing them to meet the customer demands and maintain a competitive advantage.

- He has defined and managed the Release Engineering and DevOps capabilities, including building DevOps teams from the ground up. These responsibilities included managing a large number of servers, along with the configuration and maintenance of multiple testing and production environments.

- He has successfully directed teams to create the full tool chain automation. This enabled the teams to deploy large number of applications into production without a hitch. In this capacity, he regularly coordinates and collaborates with the App Devs, Quality Assurance, Operations, Marketing, Compliance and other business units to deliver features to the customers.

- He has experience with database administration. He successfully automated the process of data mining from multiple sources using SSAS and sending it to SQL servers using SSIS. This streamlined the process, removed the need for a group of analysts to manually pull the data and lowered the daily time requirements by over 90%. 

- He moved into leading development and architecture teams. He has worked with developers to develop tools for the administration of applications and to monitor for errors and downtime. He was also in charge providing production support by troubleshooting VNETs, Load Balancers and IIS issues.  

- Matt has worked with numerous toolchains to aid with the delivery of code into production. He has learned to analyze the needs of each customer in order to find a solution that will best fit their need. 

- Matt has created multiple configuration platforms that secure the sensitive information that changes for each environment (connection strings, username/password, api keys, etc). 

- Matt has enabled many clients to make the jump from physical servers to virtual machines and from virtual machines to the cloud. He has had the opportunity to utilize multiple cloud service providers for multiple clients and works with each new customer to determine the best possible outcome for the situation at hand. 

- Matt's current project is working with Azure KeyVault and Azure active directory in order to better secure sensitive information.
